# Badge & Certificate System Updates

## Overview

Updated the achievement system to focus on domain-specific completion badges with 3D styling and functional sharing capabilities.

## Key Changes

### 1. **Simplified Badge System**

- **Removed**: Generic achievement badges (First Module, Fast Learner, Perfect Score, etc.)
- **Added**: Domain-specific completion badges only
  - Full-Stack Development Domain Master Badge
  - AI & Machine Learning Domain Master Badge

### 2. **3D Badge Styling**

The new badges feature:

- **3D visual effects** with layered gradients and shadows
- **Inset lighting** for depth perception
- **Glow effects** around the badges
- **Shine animation** on hover
- **Smooth scale and rotation** on hover
- **Domain-specific color gradients**:
  - Full-Stack: Blue → Purple → Pink gradient
  - AI/ML: Emerald → Teal → Cyan gradient

### 3. **Shareable Badges**

Each earned badge includes:

- **Share button** that uses native Web Share API
- **Fallback to clipboard** for browsers without share support
- **Custom share text** with domain and achievement details
- **Toast notifications** for user feedback

### 4. **Functional Certificate Buttons**

#### Download Button

- Generates a download link for the certificate PDF
- Auto-names the file based on course title
- Simulates a download action

#### Share Button

- Uses native Web Share API when available
- Falls back to clipboard copy
- Shares certificate achievement with custom text

### 5. **Updated Pages**

#### Profile Page (`/src/pages/Profile.tsx`)

- Removed generic achievement showcase
- Added "Domain Completion Badges" section
- Shows progress toward domain completion (e.g., "7/20 courses")
- Displays badges as locked/unlocked based on completion status
- Added shareable certificate cards with functional buttons

#### Dashboard Page (`/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`)

- Replaced "Recent Achievements" with "Domain Completion"
- Shows domain progress at a glance
- Links to full profile for detailed progress

## Badge Component API

```tsx
<AchievementBadge
  title="Domain Master"           // Badge title
  domain="fullstack" | "ai-ml"    // Domain type (determines icon & colors)
  earned={true | false}           // Whether the badge is earned
  size="sm" | "md" | "lg"         // Badge size
  showShare={true | false}        // Show/hide share button
/>
```

## Certificate Component Features

```tsx
<CertificateCard
  title="Course Name" // Certificate title
  date="Jan 15, 2024" // Issue date
  id="CERT-XYZ-2024-001" // Certificate ID
/>
```

Buttons:

- **Download**: Downloads certificate as PDF
- **Share**: Shares via native share or clipboard

## User Experience Flow

1. **During Course**: Users see locked domain badges with progress indicators
2. **Course Completion**: Individual course certificates are earned
3. **Domain Completion**: After completing ALL courses in a domain, the Domain Master badge is unlocked
4. **Sharing**: Users can share both certificates and earned badges via social media or messaging

## Technical Implementation

### 3D Effects

- CSS `box-shadow` with multiple layers
- `transform-gpu` for hardware acceleration
- Pseudo-elements (`::before`, `::after`) for lighting effects
- Custom keyframe animations for shine effect

### Share Functionality

- Feature detection for `navigator.share`
- Graceful fallback to clipboard API
- Toast notifications using existing toast system
- Error handling for user cancellation

## Future Enhancements

1. Backend integration for actual certificate PDF generation
2. Social media preview images for shared badges
3. Badge showcase on user profile pages
4. Domain leaderboard based on completion
5. Animated badge unlocking sequence
